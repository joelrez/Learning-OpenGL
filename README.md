# Learning OpenGL
 
Written using the API OpenGL v3.3, GLFW, GLEW, and GLM with x86 or 32 bit architecture.

# Update 9/14/2021
I looked into more detail how GLFW works, and I learned new features that I can play with.

Above, I am getting an intuition for the local space and vertex/fragment shaders, and I am playing with linear transformations. I am playing with the model matrix to rotate the triangle and resize it, then passing this matrix into the shader program.

# Update 9/15/2021
I am learning about applying textures to primitives, and I am implementing indexed draw to draw rectangles.
